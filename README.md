# Assignment B-4, Option A: Strings and functional programming in R

This is the Assignment B-4 of STAT545B repository of Berke Ucar. This repository contains 2 selected Strings and functional programming exercise solutions. The exercises are as follows:

1. From a book, filter out the stop words and analyze the most used words in that book with a plot.
2. Develop a function that converts words into a customized Pig Latin word. 

In this repository, there are 2 main files and a directory associated with the markdown files.

**assignment_b4.Rmd**: This file contains the solutions of these 2 exercises and their explanations and codes. 
**assignment_b4.md**: This file has the same content with _assignment_b4.Rmd_. This is the file that provides a presentable view to the web interface. This file is the one that one should be looking if they are reviewing the repository from their web browser.
**assignment_b4-files**: This folder contains the figure drawn in the above two files. 

In order to reproduce this work, one should first clone the repository to their local. Then, using an IDE, one can knit _assignment_b4.Rmd_ file or run their code chunks individually. Knitting _assignment_b4.Rmd_ produces a new _assignment_b4.md_ file and overwrites the figure contained in _assignment_b4-files_. Hence, one can change the name of the file in their local and then knit the file to not overwrite information on the original files.
